Tic Tac Toe Game
==================
Introduction
------------
This single-paged web application (SPA) was developed as the first project in my course at General Assembly. It was a difficult project, to be sure, especially considering the timeframe alloted. However, overall, it was a great experience. You don't better yourself by sitting on the sidelines and playing it safe.

Technologies Used
-----------------
The web application was written in and using the following technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* git/GitHub
* Atom

_This application was developed on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. No Microsoft developers were harmed during the making of this application._

Development and Planning
------------------------
When it comes to anything that I do, I'm more of a "pantster" than I am a "plotter," that is, I tend to develop as I go rather than methodically plan in detail. The same was true for this project: I had a general knowledge of what to do and how to do it, but once I rolled up my sleeves and started working, the development took on a life of its own.

I knew immediately that I wanted to have tha ability to hide and show different sections, so, when I wrote the HTML, I wrote it with sections and divs with particular IDs which I could easily reference with the undelying JavaScript that would come later.

After generating the HTML, I starting writing the linkages to the AJAX API (created by General Assembly) and all of the other JavaScript code to operate the game and manipulate the DOM. As CSS is a weakness of mine, I decided the the fewer the frills, the better. I plan to add more animation and visual effects once I become more knowledgeable and proficient in CSS.


Wireframes
----------
These wireframes are quite basic: part of that was intentional (as I knew that my thinking would develop throghout the development stage), and part of that was due to my lack of experience. This is my first web application of its scale, using JavaScript and CSS.

Some of these items were not achievable in the first iteration of the application.

Known Bugs and To-dos
---------------------
### Bugs
At this stage, I'm unaware of any faults in the application. That doesn't mean that there aren't any, however. Please feel free to contact me at ```guy dot b dot benson at gmail dot com``` for issues.

### To-dos
* At some point, I would like to make this a fully-interactive two-player game which can be played asynchronously. I estimate that it will take another 10-12 hours of dedicated work to achieve that.
* The code could be cleaned up a little bit. I would like to paramaterize the HTML so that there are no hard-coded values in the underlying JavaScript.
* The CSS used in the rendering can be greatly improved. Unfortunately, as this is a weakness of mine, I would need to gain some knonwledge and experience before providing a *shit hot* experience.

About Me
--------
I am an aerospace engineer by education and a software engineer by experience. I’ve always been intrigued by using software to solve practical problems, whether it be something as simple as providing an HTML interface for viewing invoices or something as complex as modeling the fluid flow through a rocket thruster. I recently decided to upgrade my skill set with an immersive software engineering program at General Assembly, and I am now taking my ambitions to the next level. I am eager and excited to take on those sometimes seemingly unsurmountable challenges regarding major problems that affect all of our society, and am especially interested in those problems affecting the underprivileged.
